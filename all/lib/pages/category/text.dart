const String sob1 = "A prerequisite for any good bamboo construction is the selection of mature and de–starched bamboo. The mature Bamboo in 3–4 years old and a dry bamboo means the starch content is considerably decreased when the felled bamboo are kept under water. A good source of such bamboo is the riverside market where the bamboos have been transported along the waterway. This sets a natural preservation process in motion whereby the bamboo becomes less prone to borer attack.";
const String sob2 = "• Selection of mature and straight bamboo pieces.\n• Use of bamboo having thick walls (8mm - 10 mm or more) and outer diameter 80mm - 100 mm or more is preferred for Columns, Beams and Truss.\n• Use of bamboo having thin walls (4mm - 8 mm) and outer diameter 50mm - 75mm is preferred for Purlins.\n• Inter nodal distance less is preferable.\n• Bamboo should be free from any defects\n• Smooth cover should not be peeled off.";

Usually the bamboo works start from above the plinth and away from any rain splashing. The roof overhangs are large to protect the structure from rain and extreme weather.";
